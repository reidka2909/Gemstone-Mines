### [Article Summary](https://www.iied.org/sapphire-mines-become-forests) 
<p> Madagascar, 2017 - Madagascar is learning from their past and each other. Artisan small-scale mining (ASM) has devoured the landscape of Madagascar
since the 90's. ASM operations are in search of sapphires and sweep in overnight. This form of mining is largely informal and unregulated for fear 
of authority and loss of income. These miners are not large well accommodated companies. They are typically people working to survive. Approximately 
75% of Madagascar's population is living below the poverty line. </p>

<p> Miners have little to no training or expertise in evaluating the grade, setting a price and no regulation on enforcement of fair pricing. Most gemstone 
markets are unregulated. These miners experience scams and unfair pricing do to little education about diversifying they stones they mine, a connection between 
small producers and buyers as well as few resources such as equipment to determine the quality of the stones. </p>
  
<p> Many mines are abandoned within a short time. They are typically 50 meters deep and extremely dangerous. They can cause physical injuries to people and
 animals, along with releasing toxic chemicals.</p>

<p> This map application displays Ruby, Emerald, and Sapphire mines globally. These features can be compared to each other, the general physical geography and
 major population centers. Many of the mine locations fall along the lines of tectonic plates possibly due to increase in pressure on the mineral deposits.
